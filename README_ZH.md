```
增加ubuntu 的docker安装方法
使用官方安装脚本自动安装
安装命令如下：

requirment.txt的安装
对ubuntu系统
python3.7 -m pip install Scrapy
python3.7 -m pip install virtualenv
apt-get install python3.7-dev
python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt


## Setting up config file
```
cp config_sample.env config.env
```
- Remove the first line saying:
```
_____REMOVE_THIS_LINE_____=True
```
Fill up rest of the fields. Meaning of each fields are discussed below:
- **BOT_TOKEN** : The telegram bot token that you get from @BotFather
- **GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID** : This is the folder ID of the Google Drive Folder to which you want to upload all the mirrors.
- **TELEGRAPH_TOKEN** : Telegraph token generated by running :
```
python3 generate_telegraph_token.py
```
- **DOWNLOAD_DIR** : The path to the local folder where the downloads should be downloaded to
- **DOWNLOAD_STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL** : A short interval of time in seconds after which the Mirror progress message is updated. (I recommend to keep it 5 seconds at least)

- **AUTO_DELETE_MESSAGE_DURATION** : Interval of time (in seconds), after which the bot deletes it's message (and command message) which is expected to be viewed instantly. Note: Set to -1 to never automatically delete messages
- **IS_TEAM_DRIVE** : (Optional field) Set to "True" if GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID is from a Team Drive else False or Leave it empty.
- **USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS**: (Optional field) (Leave empty if unsure) Whether to use service accounts or not. For this to work see  "Using service accounts" section below.
- **INDEX_URL** : (Optional field) Refer to https://github.com/maple3142/GDIndex/ The URL should not have any trailing '/'
- **API_KEY** : This is to authenticate to your telegram account for downloading Telegram files. You can get this from https://my.telegram.org DO NOT put this in quotes.
- **API_HASH** : This is to authenticate to your telegram account for downloading Telegram files. You can get this from https://my.telegram.org
- **USER_SESSION_STRING** : Session string generated by running:
```
        python3 generate_string_session.py
```
                         需要输入上面的API_KEY 和API_HASH 还要输入上面的bot_token
- **MEGA_API_KEY**: Mega.nz api key to mirror mega.nz links. Get it from [Mega SDK Page](https://mega.nz/sdk)   //如果没有账号可以不用填写
- **MEGA_EMAIL_ID**: Your email id you used to sign up on mega.nz for using premium accounts (Leave th)   //如果没有账号可以不用填写
- **MEGA_PASSWORD**: Your password for your mega.nz account   //如果没有账号可以不用填写

Note: You can limit maximum concurrent downloads by changing the value of MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS in aria.sh. By default, it's set to 2
 
## Getting Google OAuth API credential file  获取验证文件，用来对google api进行操作

- Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
- Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
- Choose Desktop and Create.
- Use the download button to download your credentials.
- Move that file to the root of mirror-bot, and rename it to credentials.json
- Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library) 
- Search for Drive and enable it if it is disabled
- Finally, run the script to generate token file (token.pickle) for Google Drive:
```

python3 generate_drive_token.py
```
## Deploying

- Start docker daemon (skip if already running):

```
  docker images
```
- 删除操作

```
  docker image rm IMAGE ID
```
- 删除容器
```
  docker rm 容器id
```
- 停止docker，docker启动后在窗口下无法停止，需要新开一个命令窗口

# Using service accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit   突破上传限制
For Service Account to work, you must set USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS="True" in config file or environment variables
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts
## Generating service accounts
Step 1. Generate service accounts [What is service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
---------------------------------
Let us create only the service accounts that we need. 
**Warning:** abuse of this feature is not the aim of autorclone and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 sa allow you plenty of use, its also possible that overabuse might get your projects banned by google. 

```
Note: 1 service account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project makes 100 service accounts so thats 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice. 
```

`python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only`

A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the service accounts created

NOTE: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

### 如果已经有accounts文件夹，可以将文件夹复制到mirror-bot文件夹下面
```
   cp -rf 源文件夹 目标文件夹
```
- 对accounts文件夹里面的文件进行重命名,在./mirror-bot/accounts/下面
```
   批量重命名

  i=0; for x in *; do mv $x $i.json;let i=i+1; done

```
### Add all the service accounts to the Team Drive or folder
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```


# Youtube-dl authentication using .netrc file
For using your premium accounts in youtube-dl, edit the netrc file (in the root directory of this repository) according to following format:
```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```
where host is the name of extractor (eg. youtube, twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line
